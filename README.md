## Introduction
Chatroom is a simple command-lined chating program made by python. If you and the person who you want to chat with is in a ***LAN***([**L**ocal **A**rea **N**etwork](LAN.md)) or you and the person who you want to chat with also had a [***Public IP***](IP.md) and you **can** chat together!

And also, it supports almost every Operating System and every System Architecture. But there will be some very few kind of Operating System and System Architecture, so if you didn't found your Operating System type or your System Architecture and you **can** take an issue or you **can** build the program in yourself.

If you have a server and installed Chatroom Server on your server or you installed Chatroom Server on your computer, you just need to tell the people your [IP Address](IP.md) on your ***LAN***([**L**ocal **A**rea **N**etwork](LAN.md)) friends, then they can use Chatroom Client and input your Chatroom Server's IP Address and they can chat together! just like a group on **Discord**!
